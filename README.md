Concrete Crack Classification with Transfer Learning

Project Summary:
In this project, I developed a deep learning model to classify concrete images as cracked or non-cracked. 
Identifying cracks early is crucial for building safety and durability. The dataset used contains images of concrete with various types of cracks.

Data Preparation:
The dataset was split into training and validation sets, and data augmentation techniques like random rotations and flips were applied to prevent overfitting.

Model Development:
MobileNetV2, a pretrained model, was used for transfer learning to extract features from the images.
The model was built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with global average pooling and a softmax classifier.
Fine-tuning was done after initial training to improve performance further.

Results:
The model achieved over 90% accuracy on both training and validation sets, meeting the project goal.
The model performed well without overfitting, thanks to data augmentation and early stopping.

TensorBoard:
To visualize the model training process, I used TensorBoard for tracking the loss and accuracy. Below is a snapshot of the TensorBoard metrics:

Discussion:
The model effectively classifies concrete cracks, achieving over 90% accuracy. Using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 allowed for efficient training and feature extraction, while data augmentation ensured better generalization. 
The results show the potential for real-world applications in concrete crack detection for safety and maintenance.
